### Main File ###
1. The main file of ns3 is **AstraSimNetwork.cc**. This file containt the ASTRA-SIM network API implementation. It also defines worklaods and system input files.
2. The vector workloads (https://github.com/astra-sim/astra-sim/blob/ns3_interface_tmp2/astra-sim/network_frontend/ns3/AstraSimNetwork.cc#L22) defines the set of workloads to run at the same time. For example, the current workloads are microbenchmark All-Reduce and All-To-All.
3. The vector physical_dims (https://github.com/astra-sim/astra-sim/blob/ns3_interface_tmp2/astra-sim/network_frontend/ns3/AstraSimNetwork.cc#L26) shows the number of NPUs we want to allocate for each workload. Current values are {8, 4}, {8, 4}. This allocates the first 32 NPUs (0 : 31) to All-Reduce, and the second 32 NPUs (32 : 63) to All-To-All worklaod. Note that since the physical topology is 2D, we define we define the physical_dims for each workload as a an array with 2 elements (e.g., {8, 4}).
4. Currently, the system input file is automatically decided based on the dimensions of physical dims (https://github.com/astra-sim/astra-sim/blob/ns3_interface_tmp2/astra-sim/network_frontend/ns3/AstraSimNetwork.cc#L186). 
5. The network input file (that defines the network topology) is fed in the build.sh file (https://github.com/astra-sim/astra-sim/blob/ns3_interface_tmp2/astra-sim/network_frontend/ns3/AstraSimNetwork.cc#L26). The current input is 'mix/config.txt' (https://github.com/DartingMelody/ns3-interface/blob/main/simulation/mix/config.txt). Inside the 'mix/config.txt', there is a parameter called **TOPOLOGY_FILE** which takes the topology file.
